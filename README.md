# Music App REST API

## Overview
Welcome to the Music App REST API! This project was developed as part of a Full Stack Development course. 
The main purpose of this project is to create a RESTful API for managing a music database, focusing on backend functionality.

## Prerequisites
To run the repository locally, you need to add an .env-file with your personal password for MongoDB. The .env-file should contain one line:
